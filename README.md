## "It's in the genes"

This repository contains the resources for the HiPy's second workshop.

The objectives of the challenge are:
  + Parse a large genetic data set (from a real study on prostrate cancer)
  + Extract individual protein sequences
  + Perform some analysis on the data set
  + Plot a boxplot and barchart of the analysis

This task is pretty gritty and you'll be dealing with some advanced programming concepts here. Don't be daunted, have a good stab. A video solution/tutorial to the problem will be posted shortly after the meeting and will be available here.

#Some advice

Begin with the fastaparse module, then the geneanalyse module, before finally completing the plotting module.

Solutions can be found under the solutions branch.
