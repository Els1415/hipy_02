This task relies upon mastering the handling of strings in python, this tutorial
( http://www.learnpython.org/en/Basic_String_Operations ) provides a comprehensive
introduction to the topic. 

Of particular interest to the first function, look at the "split()" method, and how it is used.

Fasta files are widely used in biological science, a full description of them can be found
on the wikipedia page. ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format ). In reality they can 
contain huge numbers of records, so it is important for a parser to only read one record at
a time, otherwise it would be possible to run out of memory.

This can be done by using python's built in generator mode, using the yield keyword instead of 
returning a single object like most functions, a description of how generators work can be found
here ( https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators ).

The sequence should be a single string, this means you will need to STRIP() the endline characters
and spaces from the end of each line, and then JOIN() the lines together into one string when you
have reached the end of the record.
