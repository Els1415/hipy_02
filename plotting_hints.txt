For this task you will want to make use of matplotlib, the same as last week.

The syntax for creating boxplots can be found here. 
( http://matplotlib.org/examples/pylab_examples/boxplot_demo.html )

And the procedure for generating a bargraph can be found here.
( http://matplotlib.org/examples/api/barchart_demo.html )

In terms of counting the number of True entries, you may want to look at the 
built in python filter() and len() functions.
